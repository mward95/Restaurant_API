### The Cutlery Group_Project_1

## Background

The Cutlery Group set forth to review data regarding restaurants. The Cutlery Group conducted analysis to determine whether  ratings supported food quality.  Also does the price point matter in determining whatâ€™s considered e a great experience? Are there cities that review more than others? 

The collaborative effort was to gather varuius restaruant information in the most populated cities in the United States. From this data, further analysis including ratings, pricing and reviews.  From this, there could be multiple coorelations that could be reviewed.


## Work

Key tasks are the following:

* Prepare the data.

* Generate summary statistics.

* Create visuals including bar charts.

* Create a scatter plot.

* Calculate correlation and regression. 

* Submit final analysis. 

## Tools/Modules:
A Excel

B Python

C Pandas

D Matplotlib

E pprint

F Numpy

G Powerpoint

H APIs


## Analysis Questions 

Does pricing influence ratings?

Does pricing influence the number of reviews?

Does population influence rating?

Does population affect the number of reviews?

## Data Preparation

    1. Run dependency and data imports, and then merge the DataFrames into a single DataFrame.
        - Censuscsv
        - Google places API 
    2. Display the number of unique cities in the data.
    3. Display the data associated with restaurants and ratings, create a new DataFrame then clean     
       DataFrame for the remaining step.
    4. Display the updated number of unique cities.

## Summary Statistics Generation

Create summary statistics DataFrames:

     1. Utilzation of the "groupby" method to generate the city and ratings.
     
     2. Combine objects into a single summary statistics DataFrame.

## Bar Charts Creation

     1. Generate bar plots showing the total number of ratings. 
                * Create bar plot by using Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` method.

## Scatter Plot Creation 
      
      1. Generate a scatter plot of ratings versus price.

## Correlation and Regression Calculation 

      1. Create correlation coefficient and linear regression models. 
      2. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
